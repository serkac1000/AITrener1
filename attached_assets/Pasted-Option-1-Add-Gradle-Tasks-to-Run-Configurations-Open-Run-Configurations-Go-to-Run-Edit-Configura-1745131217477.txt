Option 1: Add Gradle Tasks to Run Configurations
Open Run Configurations:
Go to Run > Edit Configurations in Android Studio.
Create a New Gradle Configuration:
Click the + icon and select Gradle.
Name the configuration (e.g., Clean and Build).
In the Gradle Project field, select your project.
In the Tasks field, enter clean build to run both commands sequentially.
Save and Run:
Click Apply and OK.
Run the configuration via Run > Run 'Clean and Build' or the green play button.
Option 2: Run Shell Commands via External Tool
If you want to run these as shell commands directly:

Open External Tools:
Go to File > Settings (or Android Studio > Preferences on macOS).
Navigate to Tools > External Tools.
Add a New External Tool:
Click + to create a new tool.
Name: Gradle Clean
Program: ./gradlew (or full path to gradlew if needed, e.g., $ProjectFileDir$/gradlew).
Arguments: clean.
Working Directory: $ProjectFileDir$.
Check Synchronize files after execution for file updates.
Add Another Tool for Build:
Repeat the process for Gradle Build.
Use the same settings but set Arguments to build.
Run the Tools:
Right-click your project in the Project view, select External Tools, and choose Gradle Clean or Gradle Build.
Alternatively, assign shortcuts in Settings > Keymap for quick access.
Option 3: Add to Before Launch Tasks
To run these commands automatically before a build:

Edit Run Configuration:
Go to Run > Edit Configurations.
Select or create a run configuration (e.g., for your app).
Add Gradle Tasks:
Under Before launch, click + and select Run Gradle Task.
Choose your project and add clean as the task.
Repeat for build.
Save and Run:
Click Apply and OK.
Running the configuration will execute clean and build before launching the app.
Notes
Permissions: Ensure gradlew has executable permissions (chmod +x gradlew in terminal if needed).
Windows: Use gradlew.bat instead of ./gradlew in the command settings.
Sync Project: After running clean, you may need to sync the project (File > Sync Project with Gradle Files).
Terminal Alternative: You can run these commands directly in Android Studioâ€™s terminal (./gradlew clean and ./gradlew build).
If you encounter issues (e.g., Gradle not found), verify your Gradle setup in Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle. Let me know if you need further assistance!
